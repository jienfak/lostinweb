Set of scripts to check the user on the Internet media.
The main scripts runs other scripts multithreaded.
Using multithreading is good because mostly answering from
sites is longer than processing.
Every script gets list of user names(logins) as
arguments and prints it to stdout if page is found.
Based on "userrecon" made by "thelinuxchoice".
